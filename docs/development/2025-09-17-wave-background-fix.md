# Wave Background Implementation Fix
Date: 2025-09-17

## Summary
Fixed the wave background animation system in ImageGallerySection to use proper physics-based Canvas rendering with Perlin noise, replacing the broken SVG implementation.

## Problem
- Waves were not animating naturally
- Mouse interaction wasn't working over image gallery cards
- Movement looked like "crinkled sheets" instead of smooth sand dunes
- Incorrect implementation using SVG instead of Canvas

## Solution

### 1. Complete Component Replacement
- Replaced SVG-based wave system with Canvas-based rendering
- Implemented proper Perlin noise algorithm for natural wave movement
- Used the exact original code from 21st.dev reference implementation

### 2. Mouse Interaction Fix
- Added `pointer-events-none` to gallery grid container
- Added `pointer-events-auto` to interactive buttons
- This allows waves to receive mouse events even when hovering over cards

### 3. Visual Adjustments
- Set line opacity to 17% for subtle effect (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.17))
- Maintained original physics parameters for natural movement
- Each wave line moves independently for organic feel

## Technical Details

### Key Component Changes
- **Rendering**: SVG → Canvas
- **Noise Algorithm**: SimplexNoise → Custom Perlin2D implementation
- **Animation**: CSS transforms → Canvas drawing with requestAnimationFrame
- **Mouse Tracking**: Direct event handling with smooth interpolation

### Physics Parameters (Original Values)
```typescript
waveSpeedX = 0.0125
waveSpeedY = 0.005
waveAmpX = 32
waveAmpY = 16
xGap = 10
yGap = 32
friction = 0.925
tension = 0.005
maxCursorMove = 100
```

## Files Modified
1. `client/src/components/ui/wave-background.tsx` - Complete rewrite
2. `client/src/pages/sections/ImageGallerySection.tsx` - Added pointer-events handling
3. Minor adjustments to other section components for consistency

## Testing Notes
- Waves animate continuously with natural undulation
- Mouse interaction works across entire section including over images
- Buttons remain clickable despite pointer-events changes
- Performance is smooth with Canvas rendering

## Future Considerations
- Could add configuration props for different wave styles
- Might benefit from performance optimization for very large screens
- Could explore WebGL rendering for even better performance
