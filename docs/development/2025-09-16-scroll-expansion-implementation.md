# Scroll Expansion Hero Implementation
**Date:** September 16, 2025
**Developer:** Claude with Roderic
**Component:** ScrollExpandMedia

## Overview
Successfully implemented a smooth scroll-triggered video expansion animation for the Rallo website's Section 3. The animation features a 400x400px orange square that pins to the viewport center and expands to full video size based on scroll progress.

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Attempts
- Started with position-based expansion (video growing as it moves through viewport)
- Issues: Not matching the desired behavior, video expanded while moving

### Phase 2: Understanding the Requirement
- Requirement clarified: Video should STOP at center and expand while stationary
- Background and other elements remain fixed during expansion
- Text slides apart horizontally

### Phase 3: Scroll Hijacking Approach
- Implemented scroll prevention with micro-increments (0.0009 multiplier)
- Issues: Still had movement, not truly pinned

### Phase 4: Complex Phase Management
- Created three-phase system: scrolling → pinned → expanded-scrolling
- Used `position: fixed` during pinned phase
- Issues: Jumping/popping when transitioning between phases

### Phase 5: Final Solution - Native Sticky
- Switched to CSS `position: sticky` for natural browser behavior
- Container height: `100vh + 600px` for scroll space
- Sticky element automatically pins at top
- Smooth progress calculation based on scroll through container

## Final Technical Implementation

### Key Features
1. **400x400px orange square** (#fd815aff - Rallo orange)
2. **JetBrains Mono Thin font** with wide letter spacing (0.3em)
3. **Text animation** - "AI AGENTS" and "EVERYWHERE" slide completely off screen
4. **Video sizing** - Expands from 400x400 to 1200x680px
5. **Smooth transitions** - Linear easing with 0.15s duration

### Component Structure
```tsx
<div ref={containerRef} style={{ height: 'calc(100vh + 600px)' }}>
  <div ref={stickyRef} style={{ position: 'sticky', top: 0 }}>
    <section>
      {/* Background Image with opacity animation */}
      {/* Video/Media container with size animation */}
      {/* Text elements with horizontal translation */}
    </section>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Animation Logic
- Progress calculated from container scroll position
- Animation triggers when sticky element is stuck (top = 0)
- Progress mapped to 600px of scroll distance
- Video and text animations tied to scroll progress

## Files Created/Modified

### New Components
- `scroll-expansion-hero-sticky-final.tsx` - Final working implementation

### Modified Files
- `ScrollExpandSection.tsx` - Updated to use new component
- `scroll-expansion-hero-final.tsx` - Attempted fix for phase transitions

### Intermediate Attempts (for reference)
- `scroll-expansion-hero.tsx` - Original from shadcn
- `scroll-expansion-hero-smooth.tsx` - Scroll hijacking attempt
- `scroll-expansion-hero-pinned.tsx` - Fixed positioning attempt
- `scroll-expansion-hero-sticky.tsx` - First sticky attempt

## Problems Solved

### 1. Scroll Blocking
**Problem:** User couldn't scroll past hero section
**Solution:** Removed all preventDefault() calls, used passive event listeners

### 2. Animation Not Triggering
**Problem:** Scroll events firing but no visual change
**Solution:** Switched from event-based to position-based calculations

### 3. Double Zoom Effect
**Problem:** Video expanded then contracted then expanded again
**Solution:** Implemented one-way animation that stays expanded

### 4. Popping/Jumping
**Problem:** 100px jump when transitioning from pinned to scrolling
**Solution:** Used native `position: sticky` instead of manual phase management

### 5. Video Disappearing
**Problem:** Video vanished when unpinning
**Solution:** Removed position offsets, let sticky handle positioning

## Performance Optimizations
- Passive event listeners for scroll
- Linear transitions for immediate response
- Hardware-accelerated transforms via Framer Motion
- Minimal re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## User Feedback Integration
- Increased initial square size from 250px to 400px
- Changed color from default to Rallo orange
- Made text slide completely off screen (60-80vw instead of 25-35vw)
- Reduced final video size by 20% for better proportions
- Added JetBrains Mono Thin with wide letter spacing

## Final Result
A beautifully smooth scroll-triggered animation where:
1. Orange square scrolls into view normally
2. Sticks to viewport when reaching top
3. Expands smoothly over 600px of scrolling
4. Text slides completely apart
5. Continues scrolling naturally once expanded
6. Reverses smoothly when scrolling back up

## Lessons Learned
- Native browser features (position: sticky) often work better than complex JavaScript solutions
- Simple, direct approaches are more maintainable
- User feedback is crucial for fine-tuning animations
- Debug logging is essential for understanding complex state transitions
