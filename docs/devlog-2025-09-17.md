## Session: Scroll Animation Improvements

### Summary
Successfully implemented smooth, Apple-like scroll animations for the Rallo website, fixing multiple UX issues and improving visual flow.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Convergence Animation Implementation
**File**: `client/src/pages/sections/ImageGallerySection.tsx`
- Implemented scroll-linked convergence animation for 4 product cards (2x2 grid)
- Cards smoothly move from edges (-100px/100px) to center position as user scrolls
- Animation completes when elements reach viewport center
- Used sine wave easing for smooth, natural motion
- Maintained vertical staggering for deliberate visual flow

#### 2. Created Animation Hooks
**New Files**:
- `client/src/hooks/useScrollLinkedAnimation.ts` - Direct scroll progress mapping
- `client/src/hooks/useConvergenceAnimation.ts` - Directional scroll animations
- `client/src/hooks/useScrollDirection.ts` - Scroll direction tracking
- `client/src/hooks/useElasticScrollAnimation.ts` - Smooth elastic transitions

#### 3. Fixed Demo Button Functionality
**Issue**: Invisible wave overlay with z-20 was blocking all button clicks
**Solution**: Commented out the invisible overlay while preserving visual elements
**Impact**: Demo buttons now properly trigger modals for Video, Chat, and Voice demos

#### 4. Adjusted Accordion Section Spacing
**File**: `client/src/pages/sections/MainContentSection.tsx`
- Added 250px top margin to move accordion section down
- Reduced section gaps from 20 to 10 to halve gray area spacing
- Improved visual balance and flow

### Technical Details

#### Animation System
- Replaced trigger-based animations with true scroll-linked progress
- Progress calculated based on element position in viewport
- Smooth interpolation using direct progress mapping (removed excessive lerp smoothing)
- Sine wave easing for Apple-like smooth motion

#### Key Animation Parameters
```typescript
// Convergence animation
const startX = direction === 'left' ? -100 : 100;  // Start position
const endX = 0;  // End at center
const easedProgress = 0.5 * (1 - Math.cos(Math.PI * progress));
translateX = startX + (easedProgress * (endX - startX));
```

### Problems Solved
1. **Springy animations** - Replaced with smooth, continuous motion
2. **Elements starting off-page** - Adjusted to subtle -100px/100px offsets
3. **Animation timing** - Now completes when elements are centered in viewport
4. **Button clicks blocked** - Removed invisible overlay interference
5. **Spacing issues** - Balanced accordion section placement

### Git Operations
- Staged all changes (11 modified files, 4 new hooks)
- Created comprehensive commit with detailed message
- Merged 18 commits from origin/main
- Successfully pushed to remote repository
- Working directory is clean

### Next Steps
- Monitor animation performance on different devices
- Consider adding optional animation speed controls
- Test with real user feedback
- Optimize for mobile viewports

### Commits
- `1b15df9` - Merge branch 'main' (includes remote changes)
- `effbd23` - Fix scroll animations and UI spacing issues (our work)
- `45a6ffd` - Previous: Adjust layout to ensure content sections meet
